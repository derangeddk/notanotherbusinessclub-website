                        <h1>a) A break from everyday routine</h1>
                        <p>
                            At the end of your work day, meet people who are not caught up in your everyday work life, and get a new perspective on the work you are doing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each event has an <strong>inspiring talk or setting</strong> that helps you zoom out and regain focus on what is important in your work life.

                        <p>

                            All attendees are <strong>decision makers</strong> in businesses, and through networking you can find customers, solutions or contractors&mdash;as well as information about pitfalls in other industries, and what to avoid when interacting with them.

                            Every event takes place outdoors and includes some activity, like a campfire, kayaking, or tree climbing.
                            You get to move, you <strong>get new energy</strong>, and you leave the event feeling refreshed.

                            Physical exercise and doing something concrete lets your brain work in a different way, and helps find peace in the middle of work day stress.

                    <p>
                        <em>Not another business club</em> is... well... a business club.
                        It is an organization that plans and executes meetings for decision makers in various businesses across all industries.
                        That is, owners, CEOs, directors, middle managers with a budget, and other people who are in a position to make business decisions in their business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bringing a group of decision makers together means things can happen.
                        After all, it's a business club, so it is about business&mdash;and decision makers make business happen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The meetings take place around the end of a work day, somewhere in the Copenhagen area (usually relatively central), so it's easy to drop by on your way home from the office.
                        There will always be snacks available, so you don't starve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wearing a tie is optional.

                        A membership costs 500 DKK annually.
                        As a member of the business club you get invited to 2-4 networking events with speakers and activities annually.
                        And you get to bring up to two guests for each event, too.

                    Most of it is funded with time and money donated by these sponsors:
